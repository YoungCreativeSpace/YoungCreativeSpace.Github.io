                Scott Olberding
                </h3>
                <p class> A founder of JBAC, Scott is perhaps the member most emblematic of the group's ideals. With his Heartland sensibilities and a penchant for getting after it, this accountant, statistician, philosopher and sportsman feels equally at home bringing the ruckus to the roads, or to the dance floor. His favorite Bruce album is Nebraska.</p>

                Rob Cosby
                </h3>
                <p>Big Bob Cosby's Eastern Washington roots have ingrained in him an unparalleled toughness and ability to crush. Never one to back away from a challenge, Cos is pursuing a doctorate in clinical psychology, and is an on-line acquaintance of Drew Bledsoe's. Making Spokane truly proud, Rob is as handy on a skateboard as he is with a tool belt.</p>

                Dusty Lieb
                </h3>
                <p>Maryland-born, UPenn-learned, Virginia-hardened, Portland-perfected. Dusty is in the midst of a running Renaissance in the PNW following nearly a decade of the high finance lifestyle in Richmond, VA. He brings a unique perspective, a heck of an aerobic capacity, a beautiful young family and a standoffish Vizsla to the JBAC.</p>

                Brooks Broom
                </h3>
                <p>Brooks possesses the coolest name imaginable, and once smoked three cigarettes backwards at the same time. Now employed by Amazon - he splits his time between the Finance and Drone Warfare departments. He lives in Seattle but was raised in nearby Bellevue. A friendship stalwart and fitness enthusiast, Brooks is trouble on the trail, as well as on the speed dating circuit.</p>

                Nico Composto
                </h3>
                <p>The JBAC's sole representative in the Midwest, Nico is now chasing his dream of becoming a collegiate track coach in beautiful Peoria, IL. Occasionally Gump-like, he once completed a casual 50-miler in a time that would have placed 2nd at the USATF championships for that distance, simply because "[he] felt like running."</p>

                Jake Sienko
                </h3>
                <p>Jake is generally considered to be the JBAC member "most easily mistaken for Elijah Wood." He recently qualified for the Olympic Trials with a 1:04:35 debut half-marathon - which is probably worth noting. Hailing from Rhode Island, Jake calls drinking fountains "bubblers."</p>

                Joel Turkheimer
                </h3>
                <p>Having attended both high school and college in PDX, Turk is educationally a Portland product through-and-through. A commodities analyst by trade (what the heck does that mean?!), and an endurance man by specialty, Joel spends his remaining free time sipping artisan-blended coffee and crossing his arms.</p>

                <h3 class = "text-center">
                Russell Drummond
                </h3>
                <p>Russell is likely the most objectively interesting member of the squad, and truly is a Jacuzzi Man amongst Jacuzzi Boys. This burly engineer hails from Eugene, OR, attended a prestigious university in the land of Coors Light, and knows his way around a sailboat, as well as on the track.</p>

                <h3 class = "text-center">
                Cody Barton
                </h3>
                <p>Barton is the squad's wildcard. A native of Vancouver, WA, and an alumnus of a Cheney-based institution of higher learning, Cody also moonlights as the voice of University of Portland's women's soccer, a role in which he curses way too frequently to be appropriate. He lives in the woods and teaches high school. Nice.</p>

                Ben Paynter
                </h3>
                <p>Like Cosby, Ben is a clinical psychologist in training. Unlike Cosby, Ben is from Wisconsin, and specializes in ultra-marathons. He's an absolute whiz at Buck Hunter, a popular hunting-simulating video game, and when not wowing crowds at bars with this prowess, you can find him "sweating it out" at one of Portland's countless saunas.</p>

                Alex Dickinson
                </h3>
                <p>This freelance copywriter hails from the mean streets of Seattle, WA, and is the most accomplished cyclist of the bunch. But he's no slouch on two feet either, despite only "dabbling" in running. Alex is the resident wordsmith of the JBAC, and likely outpaces everybody else in the group in terms of coffee consumption, as he slurps it down at an alarming rate.</p>

                </h3>
                <p>Paul heads the JBAC's East Coast Syndicate. Presently presiding in Brooklyn, he can be found self-consciously nodding his head, botching interactions with new people, "riffing" with pals, or simply hanging out.</p>
